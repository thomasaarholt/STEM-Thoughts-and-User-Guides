# STEM Thoughts and User Guides
This is a repo containing a few documents I've written over the years on aligning microscopes for TEM, STEM and EELS. They should not be followed blindly, and are probably wrong in some cases, but they might be useful for someone. Suggestions and edits are extremely appreciated.

Currently it contains tips and tricks for aligning:
- FEI Titan 80-300
- JEOL ARM200F
- JEOL 2100
- GATAN GIFs
